      <h2>Shailesh Kumar</h2>
      <p>Shailesh Kumar focuses on the allegorical use of as mundane and inconspicuous an object as chair in a series of paintings, drawing inspiration from the evocative representations of chair in the works of Henri Matisse, Van Gogh, and Joseph Korsuth, as well as from his own profound contemplative observation of chairs in various settings. In his works, the chair is not merely a symbolic representation of the human being, but an allegory of the entire journey of human life itself. The chair, an otherwise inanimate and inexpressive object created by human hands, becomes a veritable metaphor for its creator, the existence of both being bound and deeply affected by time, space and societal ideas of utility. The chair is imbued with a human persona, and the trajectory of its utilitarian life is marked by the same vagaries and vicissitudes that a human life is subject to. Thus, the compositional arrangement of chairs, their physical features and their relationship with the associated spaces in his works is such that they visually narrate the dynamic life-stories of human beings. As a consequence, his allegorical depiction of chairs becomes a telling comment on the frail, vulnerable, impermanent yet aspirational nature of human lives.</p>

The topmost composition, along with the two below it, are in shades of grey, black and white that accentuate the viewer’s impression that they have long been in an irredeemable state of complete disuse---a state beyond ‘death’ that has turned them into veritable fossils. So tightly interlocked they are in this sooty ‘fossilized’ state that the very contours of individual chairs are no longer distinguishable; they are all fused into an inchoate mess. They look like a huge pile of bones in a mass grave, the remains of innumerable unidentifiable victims of some forgotten holocaust or carnage. Partly lifting this intensely dark, sombre mood is the use of color---pale reds, oranges and browns---in the last composition that, too, depicts discarded chairs with missing limbs (upholstered backs and arms). Their state of disuse is perhaps not irreversible: the presence of some color, even if dull, and their upright posture indicate that they have some spark of life left in them insofar as they have not completely lost their utility in this materialistic world. As an allegory of human life in its twilight, the chairs in all these compositions capture the last stages of life and beyond: some have lost the battle of life in death, disability or infirmity, and lie abandoned and forgotten, while others are losing their vigor to fight the battle, but are yet to burn out completely and stand the chance of a comeback.">

Starting in a clockwise fashion from the top left panel, some (e.g., panels 1, 4) have upright and intact chairs apparently still in their ‘designated’ positions in the overall furnishing, while others (e.g., panels 2, 5) have both chairs that are ‘in position’ and those that are no longer so, and still others (e.g., panels 3, 7, 8, 9) only have disused and discarded ones.  They are in varying states of desuetude: they are piled in a corner (e.g., panels 5 and 8) or lying on their sides (e.g., panels 6, 8) or tilted (e.g., panels 7), others have arms missing (e.g., panels 1, 3, 7, 9), and still others are hanging as if in limbo, waiting for some foothold (e.g., panel 2). Some even have objects lying on them (e.g., panels 2, 8, 9), perhaps a mark of their former owners/users. One chair is even in a picture (e.g., panel 7), indicating that it has gone beyond the state of disuse: it has ceased to exist. Whether in disuse, broken, or discarded, whether ‘in place’ or not, they are all vacant. Further, the rooms have a grubby, stained look, awash in shades of dull browns and yellows---some even have plaster peeling off the walls (e.g., panel 9) or creepers growing inside (e.g., panel 7). Thus, a pall of gloom, melancholy and desolation hangs on the discarded chairs in abandoned rooms. These chairs allegorize the plight of human beings: as both outlive their utility to the world, they fall by the wayside, live unattended and uncared for, and die unlamented.">

Dominating the composition and capturing the viewer’s attention, a wall formed by a multitude of discarded chairs occupies the middle region. The chairs of different designs and in different positions represent the heterogeneous humanity in different stations of life. The ones in upright position in the front seem to have found a semblance of stability amidst the chaotic mess behind, while the ones piled atop each other jostle for space to stabilize themselves. Yet inverted chairs partly resting over some of the upright ones indicate that the latter’s stability is somewhat threatened by the surrounding disorder. The vision conjured up in the discerning viewer’s mind is one of multitude of human beings battling through their mundane lives---and against each other---to find some foothold of security and stability---a perennial quest in which some succeed, but many fail. The stiff, banal wooden texture of chairs, despite their different designs, conveys the inability of individuals, though of different personalities, to break free from the cage of their dreary, conventional everyday lives. Accretions of dust from disuse on the chairs can be the marks of weariness and dullness on human bodies and minds. The oppressive ambience created by the wall of chairs is offset by the relatively limited but empty, clear spaces in the lower and upper reaches that signify the diminishing yet untapped realms of life that are unaffected by the all-consuming struggle for survival: redeeming mental spaces for quiet relaxation, introspection and contemplation. These spaces provide relief and release from the claustrophobia aroused by the impenetrable maze of interlocked chairs.">

Clusters are concentrated in the area from the left to centre and are close to the viewer, while singles are at a distance, in the right and centre. The horizon is mostly indistinct: the surface and the cloudy sky merge into each other as the clouds seem to descend on the ground. Most chairs are not upright and intact: they are turned upside down, tilted or lying on their backs, with parts (seats, legs, arms, splats, upholstered backs) missing. Scattered around them are pieces that have fallen off them or the wreckage of ones that have completely disintegrated. They all look as if they have lived out their lives and have been discarded, whether alone or together with the like ones. The uneven spatial arrangement of the chairs thus reflects their uneven life-journey: as chairs are moved through rooms and houses and used to varying degrees, they wear out their lives, and, as they lose their limbs and hence utility, they ‘die’ of disuse. Many do so sooner than others, as the distance between those closer to the viewer and those further away suggests, distance being the metaphor for time. However, very few manage to remain largely unscathed, though lonely, through this journey, as a couple of upright chairs in the distance are. Such is also the plight of their human owners and users whom they represent. Human beings, too, are subject to the vicissitudes of life: some are able to battle them longer than most, but very few come out unscathed. Narrating the tragic life-stories of inanimate chairs as an allegory of human lives, the work thus arouses a deep sense of pathos, and a profound, almost spiritual realization of the frailty of life itself.">

              <input type="hidden" name="aboutArt" value="The work poignantly depicts, through a distinctive arrangement of chairs and strong contrasts of light and dark, the tortuous ascent of the aspirational human being to the precarious pinnacle of success, power, glory or pre-eminence in a ruthless struggle against fellow human beings. At the centre is a mass of chairs haphazardly piled on each other to form a tower-like structure, topped by a red-padded throne. While the chairs beneath the throne appear more or less the same at the first glance, they are all different in design, but it is the throne that stands out, conspicuous by its ornamentation. Almost touching the clear blue sky, it represents one who has achieved crowning success by rising through the ranks, while the interlocking chairs beneath stand for all those who are still struggling to reach the top. The throne is not upright but slightly tilted, in a somewhat unsteady position, suggesting the impermanence of success, and the vulnerabilities and insecurities of even the most successful. The throne itself, or rather its occupant, is also struggling to retain its position, perhaps against those below striving to replace it. Alternatively, the tower may represent an unstable, exploitative hierarchical order in which those in the upper echelons have risen at the expense of those in the lower reaches. This tower of chairs is exposed to light, perhaps in order to highlight the unrelenting quest for success that consumes the entirety of human lives. In contrast, huge stacked piles of innumerable chairs all around the tower and reaching far into the distant hazy background form an untidy, inchoate mess with no discernible pattern, all cast in the shadows. They represent the great sea of humanity that has failed to stay afloat in this cruel, competitive world and has fallen by the wayside as discarded wreckage.
