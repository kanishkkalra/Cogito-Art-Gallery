      <h2>Tonmoy Roy</h2>
      <p>Tonmoy Roy draws on images and sights from situations of everyday life, and his own experiences and memories to create appealing visual narratives on themes as diverse as the blissful dream-world of a child and the worrisome state of global violence. Bold use of bright colors with fewer muted tones heighten the dramatic effect of his compositions, while eclectic images, whether of human beings, animals, birds, mythical beings, plants, trees, hills, houses, and water bodies, or geometric patterns and abstract designs, are so arranged as to weave together a layered narrative charged with energy and suffused with emotions and meanings. Human experience of life and world are central to his works that blend the microcosm of inner feelings, memories, aspirations, and yearnings with the macrocosm of worldly experiences and realities. Further, his works abound in the deft use of ‘beings and things’ as allegories of abstract ideas and personal views.</p>

                <input type="hidden" name="aboutArt" value="The work conjures up in bright colors a child’s dream-world or the artist’s own childhood dreams.  The child-dreamer is soundly asleep on a lotus-leaf, or rather a bed metamorphosed in dream into a lotus leaf afloat on water. All around him is a mélange of images that form his sleep-induced vision of a blissful, carefree life inhabited by real and imaginary beings and things. A winged white cow with the head of a woman lovingly watching over him represents a quaint yet caring maternal-bovine entity. Here the artist transforms an ancient mythic icon into an embodiment of a child’s deeply personal and intimate experience of mother’s love: Kamadhenu (lit., ‘wish-fulfilling cow’), a bovine mother-goddess widely venerated in Hinduism as a symbol of purity, non-erotic fertility, maternal love and sustenance, becomes, in the child’s simple vision, a blend of his own mother and a milch cow. Ordinary sights of the natural world that evoke pure innocent wonder and delight in the child revisit him in his dreams: flowing water, clouds, plants and trees, a flying white bird, and three monkeys sitting with their babies on the branches of a flowering, fruit-laden tree. The child’s and his friends’ gestures of pointing at or reaching out to the monkeys convey their joy and excitement, as re-experienced in his dream. The face of a laughing man capped with saffron cloth is unmistakably that of Birinchi Baba, a trickster in a saint’s guide in Satyajit Ray’s iconic Bengali film Mahapurush (‘The Holy Man’), a light-hearted satire on godmen and conmen preying on superstitious, gullible people. It represents cinematic images and characters strongly etched in the childhood memories of the artist or his alter-ego, the dreaming child. The collage of disparate images combine with a bright background of reds, pinks and oranges, and a scattering of blue spherical and yellow drop-like objects to produce a surreal, phantasmal effect of the vivid dreamscape.">

              <input type="hidden" name="aboutArt" value="The work exposes the symbolic freedom that the once-colonized India enjoys as a sovereign country, and the real freedom that eludes all those who inhabit this ‘free’ country. Three white airplanes leaving long trails of saffron, white and green smoke to mark the sky with the tricolor national flag is a familiar image of stunning aerobatics that are part of the state-sponsored annual pageantry celebrating the transformation of independent India into a constitutional republic in 1950. The smoky trails almost diagonally cut across the visual plane, finally merging into a pool, where they turn into industrial effluents that contaminate the water and afflict all those who drink it (represented here by two storks). Like the smoky trails, celebration of the nation’s ‘freedom’ is a mere momentary spectacle, a fleeting occasion of public jubilation, even as rampant pollution leaves a permanent trail of dead flora and fauna, and diseased human bodies. The maze of lifeless tree-branches which the planes fly through is a sad vestige of the environmental degradation that rapid greed-driven industrialization has brought in its wake. Patches of green represented by a few leaves and tendrilous plants points to the fast-shrinking green cover. The arched gate-like structure framing the planes may be a stylized representation of the iconic India Gate, a colonial-era war memorial of red sandstone proudly appropriated by the post-colonial Indian state as a national symbol. Like the smoky tricolor flag in the sky, the gate leads nowhere, not at least to any utopian land of freedom. An erupting volcano in the background; a red tree that merges with the red border framing the composition; faces of frightened, anxious or crying children---all allegorize the pervasive violence that engulfs the lives of ‘free’ people. Even the symbol of love, care and protection, a winged cherub in the sky looks distraught and seems to be fleeing from some invisible threat. An auto rickshaw and a water buffalo, common sights in urban and rural areas respectively, suggests the mundane lives of drudgery millions are unwittingly shackled to, without any hope or chance of freedom. What perhaps captures the irony of ‘un-free’ life in a ‘free’ nation is the owl that in popular belief stands for starkly conflicting ideas: fortune and misfortune, foolishness and wisdom. As a wooden toy, it sits immobile, a mute object of human ambivalence. What the composition impresses upon us: the nation’s freedom is delusory as long as its people live through the harsh reality of violence, strife, poverty, and pollution.">

One of the prominent visuals is a thin bare-bodied man, perhaps a folk dancer, wearing the mask of Chhau, a widely popular folk dance in eastern India. The mask, a unique feature of this dance form, is composed of a strikingly huge, ornamental, colorful, fan-shaped headdress surrounding the face of the three-eyed goddess Durga, an embodiment of feminine power and creative energy in Hinduism. The stark contrast between the man’s semi-clad body and the stunning mask he wears brings forth the mix of rustic simplicity and colorful vibrancy of rural life. Enhancing the bucolic mood is an array of typical sights in the world of Indian villages where nature and human lives co-exist harmoniously: a bird bringing food to eager hatchlings in a nest perched on a fruit-laden tree; a rooster whose crowing at dawn sets the rhythm of life in motion; a pumpkin patch; a muddy puddle; and huts with thatched roofs at a distance. An arched niche on the left acts as a window to this simple, self-contained world----a window from which a man, apparently the artist himself, holding a baby in his arms, invites the viewers to peer into and partake of a slice of this fast-disappearing quaint peaceful life. A reddish pink sky filled with puffy white clouds forms the background, heightening the visual delight of the blissful arcadia.">

The disproportional sizes of the entities imparts them a striking ‘unreal’ quality. Heightening the mesmeric mood are abstract patterns all over the plane: blue and green hearts, yellow bubble-like dots, curled wires, a network of thin grey intersecting lines and thick white twisted branches. Adding a pleasing scenic setting to the images are the blue background with an outline of hills, and the yellow-green ground beneath. Preponderance of curved, sinewy lines creates an impression that the entire setting is hypnotically moving to the tune of the snake charmer’s lute.">

              <input type="hidden" name="aboutArt" value="The work is a telling comment on the violent times we live in, filled with fear, hate, tension, gloom, and yet an undying hope for peace and love. The composition is horizontally divided into two halves capturing a fraught atmosphere. The upper half has a woman’s face surrounded by a black veil. The wide-eyed expressionless face conveys a passive spectatorial submission to the chaotic violence unfolding in the lower half. The black veil suggests a pall of gloom threatening to engulf the humanity represented by the woman, while the vertical white dashed lines spattering the veil symbolize tears of grief that heighten the gloom. Black strips emanate out of the veil to form a band-like row of trees with bare, leafless and skeletal branches set against a background of pale shades of green interspersed or merging with reds, browns and oranges. This conjures up an unsettling vision of pervasive environmental despoliation and desolation caused by the violence of deforestation. Symbolic images of multiform violence crowd the lower half of the composition: soldiers firing at an invisible enemy amidst raging flames suggest the violence of warfare; a (male) wolf with lolling tongue and wearing sunglasses represents the lurking violence of sexual predation; a black stream of industrial effluents flowing out of a tunnel stands for the violence of pollution; and a woman with curious green hair-like and white wing-like projections set ablaze is an embodied fusion of nature and peace wrecked by human violence. The un-green sinuous creeper at the bottom may represent the entangling, overpowering grip of violence. At the same time, this imagery of orgiastic violence is punctuated by that of hope for peace and love: floating blue hearts, a girl embracing a semi-anthropomorphized white dove and a red rose sprouting at the centre. The preponderance of women as symbols underlines their key status as both universal victims of masculine violence and messengers of love and peace.">
